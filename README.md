# Final Project - NaviBot

### Our project aims to develop a simulation robot that helps an individual to find a destination by walking them through the path. Our robot will input the destination from the user through speech recognition and communicate with the user to guide him till they reach their destination.

* Perception
  * This component deals with the part of the robot that is responsible for understanding the world around the robot. This deals with the odometry such as the      distance traveled by the robot and the laser scanner used to detect and avoid obstacles.
* Navigation
  * This component understands the local map, i.e. the given map, and validates whether the robot is currently on the path generated by the guide component.
* Guide
  This component is responsible for generating the shortest path from its current position to its destination.. It takes into account all the sensor data and generates the shortest path while avoiding obstacles on the way.
* Control
  * This component is responsible for controlling the robot. It controls the actuators of the robot.
